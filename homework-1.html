<h1>Whales</h1>

<p>Wikipedia tells us this about <strong>whales:</strong>

<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale">
  <p>Whale is the common name for various marine mammals of
    the order Cetacea. The term whale sometimes refers to
    all cetaceans, but more often it excludes dolphins and
    porpoises, which belong to the suborder Odontoceti
    (toothed whales). This suborder includes the sperm whale,
    killer whale, pilot whale, and beluga whale. The other
    cetacean suborder, Mysticeti (baleen whales), comprises
    filter feeders who eat small organisms caught by straining
    seawater through a comblike structure found in the mouth
    called baleen. This suborder includes the blue whale, the
    humpback whale, the bowhead whale and the minke whale.
    All cetaceans have forelimbs modified as fins, a tail
    with horizontal flukes, and nasal openings (blowholes)
    on top of the head.</p>

<p>But I like whales because they are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Huge!</li>
    <li>Friendly</li>
    <li>Can hold their breath for a long time</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Whale Anatomy</h2>

<p>There are some key parts to a whale's anatomy that I think are
  intersting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Blowhole:</strong>Whales breathe via blowholes; baleen
      whales have two and toothed whales have one. These are located
      on the top of the head, allowing the animal to remain almost
      completely submerged while breathing. Breathing involves
      expelling stale air (which is warm and moist), as well as
      some mucus and excess water from the blowhole, forming an upward,
      steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs.
      Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.
    </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ears:</strong>The whale ear has specific adaptations to
      the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an
      impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and
      the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In aquatic mammals, such as
      whales, however, there is no great difference between the outer
      and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer
      ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat,
      from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to
      the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the
      skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional
      hearing underwater.
